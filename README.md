### Overview
Run the two programs on two computers connected with the same WiFi or with the same network. If network is not available, both programs could be run on same computer and use IP 127.0.0.1 (loopback IP). Firewalls and anti-virus might need to be disabled for this to work. If we run the ServerAssignII file on any computer, it will go in the background and start a popup message service. This means that any other computer (or the same) running the ClientAssignII program could send a popup text message in notepad to the computer on the server end.
